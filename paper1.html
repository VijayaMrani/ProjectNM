        <h1>FP ALGORITHM IN BIG DATA
            USING MAP REDUCE MODEL.
           </h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            We are living in an era of data; enormous amount of data is generated and stored every micro second around us. Organizing these data and retrieving valuable information and understanding the knowledge behind them and using that knowledge to develop the intelligence artificially is the need of the hour. We have many efficient algorithms to mine that knowledge but that efficiency becomes a question when the volume of data increases. Apriori algorithm, is one such algorithm that efficiently mines the knowledge by finding the frequent patterns from dataset, but the efficiency reduces when the data size becomes enormous. So, we include the concept of map reduce along with Apriori algorithm to find the frequent item sets in a big data environment. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a model to imply the Apriori algorithm using the map reduce paradigm to find frequent pattern in big data environment.
